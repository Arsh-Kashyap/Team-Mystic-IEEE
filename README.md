#Challenge 2
##Context:

A Company provides academic support to students of Grade 11 & 12. It nurtures 21st century transferable skills in the students through its CORE model based on Critical thinking, Collaboration, Ownership, Resilience, and Empathy. It builds awareness and confidence in the students through career counselling, support from mentors, and internship opportunities. Ultimately, Company work towards grooming all their students as leader by providing them various leadership opportunities like student mentorship, student-led clubs, and student advisory council.
The Company supported more than 700 students holistically in Grade 11 and 12 in the Pilot Year (2020-21). 80% of the students have either led a club or participated actively in these clubs, 10% have worked on real-time projects through internship programs. High school students from government/low-income private schools who migrated to their villages during the pandemic attended the company online classes. Skilled workforce from different parts of the country joined the Online Holistic Education support program for high school students.
Their goal for the next 5 years is to impact at least 25,000 students with holistic and student-centric education, to build an online community of at least 1000 leaders who will work towards eliminating education inequality. They strive to provide comprehensive, holistic and quality high-school educational support available at one platform for a very affordable price of Rs 500 per month.

##Challenge:
The challenge is to measure and enhance teacher student engagement. An online platform which can help in providing real-time feedback to the teachers by the students without switching from the online session. The feedback should be able to detect whenever a student is distracted like switching between the tabs or using any other social media platforms while the session is in progress. The platform should be determining the results of the engagement based on the provided feedback.
Additional Considerations:

- The online platform should be able to sustain in low internet bandwidth.
- Create a reward system where the student gets reward points when they provide the feedback.
- Multilingual Platform.
